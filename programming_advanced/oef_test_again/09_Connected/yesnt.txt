Input/Output

Input
5 --> nr of nodes
3 --> nr of edges
0,1,8 --> node 1, node 2, weight
2,3,6
3,4,9
output
not connected
explanation
There is no connection between 1 and 2

 

Input
3 --> nr of nodes
2 --> nr of edges
0,1,8
1,2,9
output
connected
explanation
All nodes are connected, we can travel from node 0 to node 2
