Given a string, check if it has balanced brackets. Balanced brackets mean that an opening bracket always has a corresponding closing symbol. You have to deal with the following brackets: ( ), [ ], < > and { }. 
The output must be one of the following sentences: 'Not balanced expression', 'Balanced expression', 'Too many close symbols' and 'Too many open symbols'.

Hint: work with a stack, because the last opened bracket must always be closed first (FILO).

Try to solve each exercise in different ways, always start from the naive approach first (brute force), and then try to work more efficiently based on what we saw in the lesson! Think what Big(O) could be!

CodeGrade Setup = .Net framework 6.0

Input/Output
input:
([{{[()]}}]))
output:
Too many close symbols

input:
This {is} a balanced [string]!
output:
Balanced expression!

Code instructions

To solve this assignment you need to create a Module_03 namespace with an Assignment-class and a method Balance

namespace Module_03
{
  public class Assignment
  {
    public string Balance(string input)
    {}
  }
}
